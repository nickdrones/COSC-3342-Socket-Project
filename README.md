### COSC 3342 Fall 2020 - Socket Project

This is my code for the socket project for Networking class.

======================================

Compile the code:
> gcc -o socket socket.c

Run the code:
> ./socket (portnumber)

Send demo command using netcat:
> echo -n "payload" | nc (ip addr of server) (port)

Or use telnet to connect to ip and port for 2-way communication
